Pybank Analysis
I analyzed the financial records from a CSV file, budget_data.csv, to compute a series of financial metrics. Upon running the script, I calculated the total number of months present in the dataset, the total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the average change in "Profit/Losses" between months, and the dates and values of the greatest increase and decrease in profits. The results indicate that there are 86 months of data with a total net profit/loss of $22,564,198. The average change in profits/losses from month to month is a decrease of $8,311.11. The greatest increase in profits occurred in August 2016 with an amount of $1,862,002, while the most significant drop in profits happened in February 2014 with a value of -$1,825,558. This information is printed to the and saved as text file.
This financial analysis gives an overview of the company's financial health and performance over a certain period. By determining the average change in profits, the company can assess its typical monthly performance. Furthermore, pinpointing the months with the most significant profit increases and decreases can help identify particularly successful or challenging periods.

Pypoll Analysis
I processed the election data from a CSV file to calculate and display key election metrics, including the total number of votes, each candidate's vote percentage, and their respective vote counts. The code initializes variables to store the total number of votes ('Totalvote'), a list of unique candidates ('Candidates'), and dictionaries to store vote counts for each candidate (candidateVoteCount) as well as their voting percentages ('candidateVotePercentage'). I created the script through each row of the CSV file, that's allowed to tally the votes for the respective candidates.
The output indicates that the election had 369,711 total votes. Of the three candidates, Diana DeGette received the majority of the votes with 73.812% (equating to 272,892 votes), making her the winner. Charles Casper Stockham secured 23.049% of the votes (or 85,213 votes), and Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.139% of the votes, amounting to 11,606 votes. After displaying the results, as requested I wrote the findings into text file.
